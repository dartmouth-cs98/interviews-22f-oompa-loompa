# Need Finding Interviews

## Interview 1:
* name: Jane Doe (person asked to not be identified)
* date: 09/14/2022
* occupation: Graduate
* relationship to interviewers: (Previous) Co-worker
* location: US
* interview partner: None.

### Some potential questions to get you started

* What does your day to day life look like?
Wake up, bring breakfast (sometimes prepare the night before) to work.
Work until 12:00 (brief timeline outlined below)
  
  * Use carpool to get to work
    - Tell me more about the process
    * Gets coffee, socializes with other co-workers for a while, eats breakfast on her desk or with others in another space.
    * Starts working. When bored, she either:
      - goes to bathroom (scrolls insta, call mom) or,
      - goes to friend's desk

  * Pain points
    As an intern new to the area, she didn't know how to navigate it. Friends would park their cars in places she would have hard time finding. Used google maps but it was still confusing.

After noon:
Get lunch (via carpool, or coworker dives, or she brings in her own lunch)
After work, carpool again to get back home

Spin class, watch stuff
Pain point: making dinner (taking nap because it makes her too lazy to prep dinner)

* What are the hardest parts of your day? In general/long term?
Workplace is far away. She has to get up ~2h earlier. What could be solution? She says one remedy is working from home. She could use public transporting but it has multiple connections so not worth it. Or maybe Uber but she needs to calculate costs --> wishes Uber had a discount program for regularly occurring (scheduled) trips such as daily trips at specific hours.

Desk job is boring.

* If you had a lot of skills and money, what would you make or do?
She would travel. 
Start a foundation (she had scholarship for both high school and college so she thinks it changes / impacts the student's life), explore cultures / arts.
Imagine you won the lottery -> investing and maybe starting her own companies

* What is a time that you were pissed off at something?
There is a person at work that makes annoying comments that would piss her off.
Someone kicking her seat during a flight.
When people say they are going to do something but they don't.

* What is a time you noticed a clever solution to something?
shower head was broken (would turn to left) so she would have to keep changing her position. She used a face mask gel to stabilize it to an optimal location.

* What are some things you like?
1. Listening to nostalgic and depressing songs.
2. Microsoft's One Note and Notion.
3. Pomodoro timer.
4. study.io.
  - Why?
  Virtual background - her office is dark and ugly so that background visuals help her mood
  if she doesn't work for a set time she would distract herself by checking her phone and etc.

* What do you dislike?
1. Dark office spaces.
2. Ads on apps.

* Products that you wished existed?
Uber but for long term regularly occurring discounted trips.

* What was your best/worst/craziest/most memorable experience with (area of focus)?
Good experience: Rented mopeds and toured around island .
Bad experience: Tried to check in for an international flight and kept receiving errors (lufthansa). For country of issuance (of visa) there was no option for her country --> unpleasant experience checking-in for international flights.


### Record Any Observations

* What were they doing while you asked them stuff?

* Any particular reactions / emotions during the interview or specific questions?
Perhaps a bit overwhelmed by the scope of questions. Perhaps a better approach would have been to spread out the interview into 3 parts (once per 3 days) to go back to some of the more general questions so the interviewee has time to think about the answers. Given different schedules and upcoming deadline for this assignment, it wasn't feasible to do that. However, for future interviews, I am thinking of following this approach.

### Reflect / Conclusions

"How might we make it easy to navigate car parks?" 
  * Target audience: Pretty much everyone with a mobile phone.
  * I think a potential solution should not be a separate app but include a more refined approach to existing solutions and integrating it to existing platforms (Google Maps). For example, grid solution to park visualization could help people navigate these spaces on Google Maps. We could generate these grids two way:
    1. Use standard grid dimension per vehicle because the disrepancy between a car spot in one park should not be that different in terms of dimension than one in another location.
    2. Use existing satellite images to create digital outline of the grid.
  We can then number the grids so that people can find these spots more easily.

"How might we create an on-demand experience to elevate people's moods at work?"
  * Target audience: People working from office.
  * People working from office in various settings experience decrease in productivity and positive emotions due to office layout and lightings (among other things).
  * The solution would be more relevant to experience design than anything super technological. Since we cannot change every office in the world, we would have to utilize computers to create visuals and sounds that elevate people's experience working in the office. There are existing platforms that already do this, but it could definitely be improved.
